# Minimal Axum Template (!WIP!)
The idea for this repo is a minimal axum template which I or others can use as a base for building projects. I found myself constantly coding the same boilerplate at the beginning of a project, so I decided to create this template.

## Features
- [x] User management
- [x] JWT based authentication
- [x] CSFR protection
- [x] Database migration
- [x] State based resource access
- [x] E-Mail verification

I am always happy for suggestions and contributions. If you have any ideas or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
